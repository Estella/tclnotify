Hi Ellenor Malik (Janice Johnson?),

back when I first wrote the script, the repository didn't have an entry for licensing iirc. I like the MIT License, too. So feel free to consider it licensed under the MIT terms for you.

Good luck with your demonstrator!

Sincerly,

Gotisch

    It specifies GPL3. Is that the GNU GPL v3, or the v3 "or at my option any later extant version"?

    Additionally, I am writing a piece of software that includes a modified version of your software as the notifier part of a demonstrator for a CriTcl libnotify shim. While I do not have an objection, moral or otherwise, to the GPL (versions 1, 2 or 3), I prefer that software I write myself be distributed under the terms of the M.I.T. or I.S.C. licenses. If I include your software as a demonstrator, that counts as deriving a work from a GPL'd work, and is therefore legally impermissible unless the wider work is distributed under the terms of the GPL. I would like to ask how much I'd have to pay you to get a worldwide license to use your code under terms similar to the LGPL, rather than the full GPL.

    Now I am aware that you might have not even read the GPL, and merely used it because it's the same terms as WeeChat itself - I am guilty of the same thing. That's why I prefer that my own works are distributed under simplistic, BSD-like licenses.
